# üåç Climate and CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Analysis  

This project offers an **in-depth exploration of climate trends and CO‚ÇÇ emissions** across time and regions, using **real-world data**. 
Through a variety of visualizations, it highlights key insights into global temperature trends and CO‚ÇÇ emissions patterns by country and sector.
The project contains a Jupyter Notebook with all the **analysis and visualizations**.

## üìä Visualizations and Insights  
Here are the visualizations included in this project:

### **CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Dataset Visualizations**  
1. **Global CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Over Time (Line Plot)**  
   - Displays the trend of emissions from 1750 to 2022.

2. **Top 10 CO‚ÇÇ Emitting Countries**  
   - Highlights the top 10 CO‚ÇÇ emitting countries for a recent year.

3. **Emissions by Energy Source**  
   - Shows the evolution of emissions from **coal, oil, gas, cement, and flaring**.

4. **CO‚ÇÇ Per Capita Emissions Distribution**  
   - Provides the spread of CO‚ÇÇ emissions per person by year.

5. **Trends for Key Countries**  
   - Compares the emissions trends for selected countries (e.g., USA, China, India).

6. **Regional Emissions Contribution**  
   - Displays the percentage contribution of different regions to global emissions.

### **Temperature Dataset Visualizations**
